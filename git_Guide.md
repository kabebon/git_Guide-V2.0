# Hello, world!
## Git instruction is here :0, let's check your gained experience.

 1. Starting from installing the git from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). 
2. When finished, install [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 
3. Create a folder with any name on your desktop. For example: "gitBeginner"
4. Open MVSC and open your empty folder using: File > Open folder and choose your folder.
5. In opened folder create a file with extension __.md__ with any name.
That's it! You are ready to communicate with git, but wait. Let's open a terminal and verify your git installation with a command <span style="color:orange"> __git --version__ </span>. If you see a version of git, congratulations! You are in the game :)

## Some commands

*  __git init__ - Initializes the folder in which git will start tracking the changes. A hidden folder is created in the folder.git 

* __git status__ - Shows the current state of the git, whether there are changes that need to be committed (saved).

* __git add__ - adds the contents of the working directory to the index (staging area) for a subsequent commit. This command is given after adding files. It is not necessary to write the whole name: the terminal will fill in the data automatically.

* __git commit__ - The git commit command takes all the data added to the index using git add and stores their cast in the internal database, and then shifts the pointer of the current branch to this cast.

* __git log__ - Change log. Before switching the file version to Git, use the git log command to see the number of saves.

* __git checkout__ - Switching between versions. To work, you need to specify not only the commit you are interested in, but also return to the one where we work using the command git checkout master.

* __git diff__ - Shows the difference between the current file and the saved one
